You'll be taken through a series of "Yes/No" questions. Every question that you respond "Yes" to shall append an appropriate task to your "Trip List" afterwards, and every "No" response will ignore the associated task.

After you've answered all questions, you'll be presented with a summary of your answers. If you find the list satisfactory, press "Yup!" to confirm your list and move on to your list page.

If Planit has gotten it all wrong, press "Nope! Try Again" to restart the process. You may do this as many times as you'd like. Planit exists to serve VIPs like you.

..click the checkbox to "check off" an item.
..click the red "x" button to remove an item from your list ("good riddance!").
..or click the "Restart List" button to do it all over again! 'It's all about the journey', and Planit is here to help.

Here's an example of a task being expanded. Planit chooses the 'Cream of the Crop' business from Yelp for your given task and finds the address using Google Maps. Click the map to see more details about that business.
